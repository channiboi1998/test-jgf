    "p_1": "As climate change threatens the world’s food sources, mangroves have become an important battleground for food security, especially in a country known to be among the most vulnerable to the impacts of a warming planet.",
    "p_2": "Recognizing this reality, Jollibee Group Foundation (JGF) shifted its employee volunteer program from watershed reforestation, which began in 2017, to mangrove reforestation in 2023, to help build protection against disasters for the surrounding communities and provide livelihood for families.",
    "p_3": "“Mangroves play a critical role in the food ecosystem. Mangrove reforestation enhances local ecosystems and marine life, which are vital sources of food for surrounding communities. This ecological support indirectly contributes to JGF’s vision of putting food on the table of every Filipino family,” JGF’s Director for Program Development and Innovation Joanna La’O said.",
    "p_4": "JGF partnered with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and local community-based organizations for its four mangrove activities in 2023. The DENR helped identify the sites for reforestation and connected JGF with its Community Environment and Natural Resources Offices (CENROs) and local groups that could supply the propagules and seedlings.",
    "p_5": "For the mangrove activities, 212 employee-volunteers from the Jollibee Foods Corporation planted 3,950 mangrove propagules. They conducted the mangrove reforestation in Alaminos, Pangasinan; Carmen, Cebu (two planting activities); and Lemery, Batangas.",
    "p_6": "“Community-based mangrove reforestation also fosters involvement and education around environmental stewardship, which in turn promotes sustainable practices. This helps in building resilient local food systems that can withstand the challenges posed by climate change,” Ms. La’O said.",
    "p_7": "According to the Biodiversity Data Journal, 6 of the 10 nations with the biggest mangrove area losses are in Asia. This includes the Philippines, whose mangrove cover decreased from 317,500 hectares in 1990 to 227,808 hectares in 2019. In 2020, the Forest Management Bureau estimated the country’s mangrove cover at 311,400 hectares.",
    "P_7": "JGF intends to establish mangrove management as a regular and long-term program under JFC’s Sustainability Agenda, similar to its Farmer Entrepreneurship Program and Busog, Lusog, Talino Program."
