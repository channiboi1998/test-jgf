  "p_1": "Jollibee Group Foundation (JGF) has long been invested in ensuring access to food, particularly among school children under its Busog, Lusog, Talino (BLT) Program. Through BLT, JGF and its partners provided daily meals to undernourished children to help them stay in school. Since 2007, the project has helped increase the attendance of pupils in class.",
  "p_2": "In 2015, JGF partnered with the Department of Education (DepEd), local government units and NGOs to set up central kitchens that serve clusters of schools for the DepEd school-based feeding program. In 2023, with the full opening of classes, fourteen (14) BLT kitchens were reactivated after these were put on hold during the pandemic. The combined kitchens served meals to more than 10,000 children."
