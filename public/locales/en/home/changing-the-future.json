  "p_1": "Since 2005, the Foundation has implemented the Access, Curriculum, and Employability (ACE) Scholarship Program to empower young underprivileged Filipinos. In recent years, JGF has strengthened the curriculum aspect by establishing Agro-Enterprise Resource Centers (AERCs) to support its initiatives for agriculture.",
  "p_2": "Don Bosco, a leading technical and vocational education and training (TVET) institution in the Philippines, reported that 86% of its graduates from 2019 to 2022, across all courses in all its centers, are employed and able to support their families and send their siblings to school. Others have either set up their own businesses or continued with further schooling.",
  "p_3": "This is a small but sure step in addressing poverty in the Philippines, where poverty incidence remains highest among fisherfolk (30.6%), farmers (30%), children (26.4%) and individuals residing in rural areas (25.7%), according to the Philippine Statistics Authority’s 2021 report on poverty incidence among the basic sectors.",
  "p_4": "Don Bosco-Legazpi in partnership with the JGF has been offering a Scholarship Program to deserving youths of the Bicol Region. This effort was started in 2016 for 25 young people. Since then, the scholarship program has grown and was able to accommodate more students in the succeeding years. In 2022, JGF opened a new opportunity for the trainees to acquire skills training in Agro-entrepreneurship (AE) to 25 deserving trainees. In 2023, the scholars of JGF completed the training for AE. Now, the support of JGF to Don Bosco-Legazpi is increasing again to a hundred new scholars for the Training Year 2024-2025, giving skills training opportunities to more deserving youths of the Bicol Region.",
  "p_5": "“Financially, JGF has been a big help to the students because the scholarship covered their consumables, including materials for training. With JGF paying for their schooling, the students were able to finish; no one had to drop out because they had no money for transportation or meals – the allowance covered those, too,” said Don Bosco-Legazpi technical director Bro. John Coral, SDB.",
  "p_6": "Most of the scholars are children of farmers and construction workers in Albay but others come from towns as far as three hours away, such as Camarines Sur, Tiwi, and Oas. Don Bosco-Legazpi noted an increased interest in agri-business among women, who make up about 75% of the center’s enrollees for the program",
  "p_7": "“Their fathers work outside the farms, in construction, so their mothers are left to take care of the farm. Now we’re seeing that while there are women in our other courses like motorcycle servicing, car mechanics and welding, the highest number of women are in agri-business,” Bro. Coral said."
