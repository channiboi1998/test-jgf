  "p_1": "When the receiver becomes the giver, and the timid farmer becomes the confident entrepreneur, the long months – sometimes years – of equipping them suddenly feel like seeds sprouting, at least for Tulay sa Pag-Unlad Inc. (TSPI).",
  "p_2": "TSPI, a non-profit organization working towards poverty alleviation by supporting microentrepreneurs and small farmers, is an implementing partner of Jollibee Group Foundation (JGF) for its Farmer Entrepreneurship Program (FEP). The program organizes and equips farmer groups with the technical skills and business acumen they need to cater to institutional markets like Jollibee Group for greater income.",
  "p_3": "According to TSPI, one of the biggest challenges in training farmers is transforming their mindsets so they can believe that they are capable not just of planting but of marketing their own quality-approved produce. Being enrolled in FEP’s Agro-Enterprise Clustering Approach (AECA) training helps in this transformation.",
  "p_4": "AECA is an eight-step, methodical training for farmers so they can manage their farms as a business and do cluster consolidation and collective marketing. Completing the coursework gives farmers not just competence but confidence in what they do.",
  "p_5": "“Even the way they view themselves have changed. We previously did a survey asking farmers what their dream was for their children, and they said they hoped none of their kids would become farmers, so they would not become poor. Now, their children are learning about being farmer-entrepreneurs, handling computer and communication tasks for their group,” TSPI Executive Director Alice Cordero said.",
  "p_6": "Since JGF partnered with TSPI in 2016, they have trained 129 farmers in AECA, 45 of whom completed their course in 2023. TSPI has seven farmer groups supplying to JFC: one calamansi and two onion groups in Nueva Ecija; one tomato and sweet bell pepper group in Nueva Vizcaya; and one onion group each in Tarlac, Bataan, and Pangasinan.",
  "p_7": "The onion farmers supplying to JFC have seen their income increase significantly – enough for them to live a comfortable life with regular food on the table and their children enrolled in schools; build their savings; and provide microinsurance coverage among association members.",
  "p_8": "“They have become self-sufficient individuals who are now sharing their blessings with the community. In the past, they had no idea how to go to the bank. Now they are bank clients and are able to transact by themselves with confidence and dignity as proud entrepreneurs. Together, living the spirit of ‘Sambayanihan’, the farmers believe in what they do,” Ms. Cordero said."
