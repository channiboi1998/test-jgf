    "p_1": "Born in the COVID-19 pandemic, Jollibee Group Foundation’s bond with a government entity and a community movement has grown stronger over the years, harnessed by their shared commitment to leave no Filipino hungry.",
    "p_2": "JGF’s engagement with the Presidential Commission for the Urban Poor (PCUP) began in 2018 but it was not until the height of the pandemic in 2020 that PCUP and JGF worked closely to provide sustenance under its FoodAID program",
    "p_3": "“Back in 2020, the biggest issue was addressing the problem of hunger. We really needed help, especially in the National Capital Region (NCR) where there were many COVID-19 cases. And then in 2022, JGF helped us again with the flooding in the Visayas and Mindanao. In 2023, we used JGF’s supply to help victims of the frequent fires in Mandaluyong and flooding in Quezon City. That’s 400–500 families per event,” said Olympia DC. Micor, PhD, PCUP’s Chief of Field Operations Division for NCR.",
    "p_4": "Through JGF’s FoodAID program, PCUP was able to fulfill its mandate as more urban poor organizations approached the government office for accreditation upon learning that they could access food support from JGF through PCUP. To date, PCUP has accredited 703 organizations in NCR alone.",
    "p_5": "“With JGF’s FoodAID program, PCUP became visible because people saw us addressing their concerns during crises… Ours is a coordinative function. We do not have the resources for this kind of assistance, but we were able to continue serving urban poor communities through the JGF partnership,” Ms. Micor said.",
    "p_6": "Another entity serving the homeless and persons deprived of liberty in Metro Manila is Kawa Pilipinas Foundation, Inc., a community kitchen supported by JGF during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "p_7": "Led by artist and activist Mae Paner (aka Juana Change), Kawa cooks 1,500 meals every Saturday and distributes them to prisons and organizations like the Missionaries of the Poor. Ms. Paner said the simple preparation of meals is an act of love as the volunteers plan the menu and add value to the products from JGF, coming up with creative dishes using the congee mix and chicken guisado.",
    "P_7": "The congee mix and chicken guisado are among the ready-to-cook food items prepared by the JFC commissary and distributed to vulnerable communities as part of JGF’s FoodAID program.",
    "p_8": "“Hunger is so real, and food is so basic. People cannot be good citizens of a country if they do not eat well… JGF is important for me to keep going because such a big company trusts Kawa and allows me to do the good I want to do in the world, which is to serve the people that need to be fed. Food unites us,” Ms. Paner said.",
    "p_9": "She said Kawa’s partnership with JGF is proof of how transformational it is to do things with love, and how powerful partnerships can be."
