  "p_1": "As the Philippines progresses into a post-pandemic normal and begins to look ahead again with big plans, Jollibee Group Foundation (JGF) moves forward in upholding our vision: for every Filipino family to have food on the table. In a world plagued by hunger, it is a dream we and our partners have spent the past 19 years working to fulfill.",
  "p_2": "This year more than ever, our work has been defined and guided by collaborations, particularly with government institutions that have sought JGF’s help to strengthen and promote programs that address hunger and food insecurity. Access to safe and nutritious food continues to be a challenge globally. In the Philippines, nearly half of Filipinos (44.7%) experience food insecurity and 1 in 10 people (9.8%) experience hunger. The magnitude of this problem is daunting but we believe that with strong, committed partners, we can improve access to food and contribute to the overall well-being of Filipino families.",
  "p_3": "In 2023, we highlight our partnerships with a pioneer microfinance organization supporting farmer-entrepreneurs; a community-based kitchen feeding the homeless and persons deprived of liberty; a well-established technical school raising interest in agri-business among the youth and women; and national government agencies such as the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.",
  "p_4": "Together, we are doing our share for the universal goal of ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture by 2030.",
  "p_5": "Aside from our external partners, we are also expanding employee engagement at Jollibee Foods Corporation (JFC). Through the Mangrove Management initiative under JFC’s Sustainability Agenda, employee volunteers work with community-based organizations to plant and rehabilitate mangroves, which will ensure the health of our marine resources and therefore, the sustainability of our food supply.",
  "p_6": "With consistency in systems thinking, commitment to harnessing our core strengths, and collaboration with institutions and communities, we at JGF believe no problem is unsolvable – even if it takes serving one table at a time."
