    "p_1": "With the Department of Education (DepEd) announcing its plan to have one central kitchen per division for its school-based feeding program (SBFP), the Busog, Lusog, Talino Central Kitchen of the Jollibee Group Foundation (JGF) has become the department’s model for expansion.",
    "p_2": "At the start of 2023, DepEd Central reached out to JGF for a partnership that involves 1) coaching regional DepEd personnel in stakeholder management, particularly pitching to local government units (LGUs) to build central kitchens for the SBFP; 2) elevating 15 BLT kitchens to become training centers and operational models for those who want to have their own central kitchens; and 3) co-producing materials for BLT training, coaching and promotion.",
    "p_3": "“More central kitchens mean more children have access to nutritious meals. Scaling up the BLT Kitchen model will enable more schools and communities to adopt a more effective and efficient way to conduct feeding programs given the systems it offers – centralized facility for large-scale feeding, while upholding food safety, systematic and efficient meal preparation and service, and centralized procurement for efficient reporting,” JGF’s Director for Partnerships and Operations Ma. Laize Ar Cruzat said.",
    "p_4": "The DepEd–JGF partnership, covering the period 2023–2025, came as JGF reactivated an initial batch of 14 BLT kitchens across the country, which had been put on hold during the pandemic. BLT kitchens are located in Pilar, Surigao del Norte; Kapalong and Asuncion, Davao del Norte; Mati, Davao Oriental; Bacnotan, La Union; and Sagay City, Negros Occidental, Sultan Kudarat, Sorsogon, Iligan City, Vigan City, Antipolo City, Roxas City, and Tagbina, Surigao del Sur.",
    "p_5": "Together, the 14 reactivated kitchens cater to over 10,000 students. By the end of 2023, JGF has also achieved its target of preparing the kitchens to become BLT training centers in 6 of 15 target areas: Iligan City, Roxas City, Kapalong, Antipolo City, Sagay and Bacnotan.",
    "p_6": "While construction of the BLT kitchens may be funded by JGF or a local implementing partner such as the LGU, the daily operations of the kitchens are funded by DepEd for its school-based feeding program.",
    "p_7": "JGF currently has 43 BLT kitchens in 33 sites."
