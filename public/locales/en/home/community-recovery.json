  "description": "Amid the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic and the onslaught of natural disasters, the Jollibee Group Foundation continued to support communities through its programs for agriculture and disaster response. The limitations posed by health and safety protocols inspired the Foundation towards providing creative solutions in pursuit of our goal to help improve lives and serve communities. \n\n The Foundation focused mainly on the Farmer Entrepreneurship Program and Jollibee Group FoodAID during this time. Although our Busog, Lusog, Talino School Feeding Kitchens were not fully utilized due to the suspension of face-to-face classes, they have been essential in preparing and providing food for our pandemic response and disaster relief efforts. \n\n Meanwhile, Anihan Technical School resumed the training of the Foundation's scholars who started their course in 2020 but had to end abruptly due to the quarantine restrictions. Nevertheless, 17 of them were able to graduate in 2021."
