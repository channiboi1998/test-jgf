  "p_1": "The <b>Farmer Entrepreneurship Program (FEP)</b> brings together stakeholders from different sectors to transform smallholder farmers from producers to agro-entrepreneurs who are capable of supplying corporate markets like Jollibee Group. The partners organize, assist, and advise farmers in every step of their agro-entrepreneurship journey so that the farmers can have increased and steady income.",
  "p_2": "In 2023, FEP farmer groups delivered 1.4 million kilos of vegetables to the Jollibee Group. This brings to over 10 million kilos of vegetables the total volume supplied by 30 farmer groups since the program was launched in 2008.",
  "p_3": "Three (3) new farmer groups, namely, Sacred Heart Savings Cooperative, Pagbiagan Multi-Purpose Cooperative and Ungab Farmers Association supplied onions to Jollibee Foods Corporation (JFC) for the first time, with a total volume of almost 100,000 kilos.",
  "p_4": "The continuous growth and success of FEP led to partnership expansion and establishment of new collaborations in 2023. The Weather Information Notification System (WINS) was enhanced with a Short Messaging System (SMS) feature and launched in collaboration with IBM's The Weather Company, Central Luzon State University (CLSU), and Jollibee Group's Business Technology Unit. WINS provided daily barangay-level weather forecast via SMS to more than 400 farmers in 84 locations, leading to wiser use of their resources.",
  "p_5": "A Memorandum of Agreement with the Department of Agriculture (DA) for the ‘‘Integration of the Value-Chain Based Agro-Entrepreneurship Clustering Approach’’ was formalized in 2023. The partnership aims to enable the DA’s Farm and Fisheries Clustering and Consolidation (F2C2) Program implementers and staff of relevant DA-attached agencies to integrate Agro-Enterprise Clustering Approach (AECA) as a complementary strategy in helping smallholder farmers improve their livelihood and in support of the Philippine Rural Development Project (PRDP). The new MOA is an expansion of the partnership between JGF and DA that started in 2022.",
  "p_6": "A Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Science and Technology - Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic, and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCAARRD) was forged to develop the entrepreneurial capacity of smallholder producers and connecting them to agriculture value chains. The partnership aims to promote sustainable agricultural practices, technology transfer, and access to knowledge and tools to improve productivity. It also focuses on improving research and development activities for science and technology-based solutions in agri-aqua enterprises. For 2023, the partnership embarked on the research and documentation of the soil health regeneration training initiated by JGF for FEP onion groups. This is part of a multiyear project to help the farmers improve soil health."
