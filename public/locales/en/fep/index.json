  "description": "The <b>Farmer Entrepreneurship Program (FEP)</b> brings together stakeholders from different sectors to transform smallholder farmers from producers to agro-entrepreneurs who are capable of supplying corporate markets like Jollibee Group. The partners organize, assist, and advise farmers in every step of their agro-entrepreneurship journey so that the farmers can have increased and steady income.\n\n In 2022, FEP farmer groups delivered 834,000 kilos of vegetables to the Jollibee Group, marking the beginning of the recovery of their agro-enterprises and exceeding targets as they rose from the pandemic.\n\n The Foundation intensified its partnerships within the Jollibee Group to meet the collective goal of helping farmers grow their livelihood through increased delivery to institutional markets. Teams across the company collaborated in this endeavor by taking part in joint strategy and business planning, ensuring capacity and volume growth, enhancing logistics capacity, and pushing for more efficient production and better use of farming technologies, among others.\n\n Last year, JGF also partnered with BanKo—the micro-finance arm of the Bank of the Philippine Islands—to pilot a financing program that would provide low-interest loans specially developed for FEP farmers.\n\n FEP continues to gain recognition for its comprehensive approach. It received the inaugural Asia Pacific Tambuli Award for Corporate Purpose - Inclusive Growth category. The FEP #GrownWithJoy Campaign also won Silver at the 2022 Anvil Awards for raising public awareness on the program through an inspiring farmer success story.",

  "efficiencyDescription": "In recent years, the Foundation has sought technology partners to increase the market competitiveness of FEP farmer groups.\n\n From 2021 to 2022, JGF worked with three farmer groups and various seed companies to conduct onion variety trials. Farmers planted different types of onion seeds and monitored their growth. By comparing data on harvest quantity, quality, and issues encountered such as pests and diseases, the farmers were able to identify the seeds most suitable to their location, soil type, and growing conditions. This exercise has become an annual practice for the farmers to keep them abreast of new seed varieties in the market.\n\n JGF engaged Harbest Agribusiness Corporation to train onion farmers on organic-based soil fertilization techniques to boost long-term soil health and lessen their dependence on synthetic chemicals. Harbest and local implementing partner Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. also prepared the AGAP Farmers Association of Magalolon for direct-to-restaurant deliveries to Chowking stores in South Luzon. The farmers learned techniques from vegetable production to post-harvest handling.\n\n The Weather Information Notification System, which was piloted in 2021, was expanded to two more farmer sites in Tagudin, Ilocos Sur, as well as San Jose and Magsaysay, Occidental Mindoro, in addition to the two original sites in Pangasinan and Nueva Ecija. Farmers receive barangay-level weather data daily through Facebook to guide their farming decisions, leading to wiser use of their resources. The project is a collaboration with IBM's The Weather Company, Central Luzon State University (CLSU), and Jollibee Group's Business Technology Unit.\n\n Lastly, JGF forged partnerships with academic and government institutions for research programs aimed at enhancing farmers’ productivity. These include CLSU, Visayas State University, Department of Agriculture – Bureau of Plant Industry, and Department of Science and Technology – Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic, and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCAARRD).",
