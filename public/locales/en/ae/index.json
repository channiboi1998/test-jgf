  "description": "In 2022, the Foundation leveled up on its advocacy to promote agro-entrepreneurship, introducing its model to more farmers, support organizations, and the youth.\n\n Continuing its partnership with Xavier University - Ateneo de Cagayan, the Foundation launched the Intermediate Course of its Agro-Entrepreneurship for Inclusive Value Chains (AEIVC) Course, which builds the capacity of participants to organize and guide farmers through the Agro-Enterprise Clustering Approach, as applied in the Farmer Entrepreneurship Program.\n\n Participants who completed the Introductory Course in 2021 and have successfully implemented their agro-enterprise plans qualified for the Intermediate Course. Building on the concepts they learned in the prior course, participants in the Intermediate Course further sharpened their agro-entrepreneurship knowledge in finding and supplying an institutional buyer for their farmer groups. The course was carried out through a combination of online and onsite coaching sessions.\n\n By the end of 2022, 205 graduates from 108 organizations have finished the Introductory Course, while 24 participants from 14 organizations comprised the pioneer batch of the Intermediate Course.\n\n These agro-enterprise facilitator graduates have brought the knowledge and skills they gained to their respective farmer sites. Over 2,000 farmers have undergone agro-entrepreneurship training. Facilitators who have completed the Intermediate Course have guided eight (8) farmer groups in test marketing their products to their target buyers.",
  "descriptionFollowUp": "Aside from building the capacity of farmers through agro-enterprise facilitators and support organizations, the Foundation also advocates for the younger generation to pursue agro-entrepreneurship. In 2022, it concluded the Agro-entrepreneurship Basic Course for learning institutions composed of technical-vocational centers, secondary schools and a farm school. The 23 participants learned the competencies and methodologies that would allow them to integrate agro-entrepreneurship in their course offerings. Among them is the Pangantucan Community High School in Bukidnon which has incorporated agro-entrepreneurship in their curriculum for junior high school students.\n\n FEP partner Sacred Heart Savings Cooperative, which runs a community-based training center for the youth, was also tapped as a resource organization for the course.",
