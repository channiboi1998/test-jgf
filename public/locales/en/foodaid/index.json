JGF oversees the program operation, Jollibee Group donates meals or develops food products, and JGF's internal and external partners mobilize the food donations to reach people in need of sustenance.\n\n In 2022, the Foundation and its partners served 1.66 million meals for families affected by the pandemic and various disasters, as well as COVID-19 frontliners. FoodAID also provided support to communities affected by major calamities, such as typhoons Agaton, Karding, and Paeng, and the massive flooding in Misamis.\n\n By working with FEP partners Lamac Multi-Purpose Cooperative and Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc., farmers whose livelihoods have been devastated by typhoons also received support through farm inputs such as seeds and fertilizers, and a refresher training on agro-entrepreneurship to help them rebuild their business.\n\n The program's ability to respond swiftly and extensively during disasters was bolstered by the roster of partners that FoodAID had grown during the pandemic. It solidified its partner base over the past year, gaining unique partnerships in addition to collaborators from existing JGF programs, the company's restaurant network, and franchisees.\n\n The Foundation received the Hall of Fame award from the Department of Social Welfare and Development, in recognition of its long-standing partnership with the government in times of calamities.",
