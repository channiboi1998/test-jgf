    "title": "Sacred Heart Savings Cooperative: Power of the Long Game",
    "preview": "The journey of agro-entrepreneurship can be truly difficult at the start, as it is an act of dreaming bigger: thinking of farming as a collective effort toward a sustainable, lucrative source of livelihood. This is why tenacity and resilience are crucial among its advocates.\n\n Among those who have dared to dream with the Foundation is Sacred Heart Savings Cooperative (SHSC), a multi-purpose cooperative based in Ilocos Sur. It has been a partner under the Farmer Entrepreneurship Program (FEP) for 10 years.\n\n",
    "followup": "Prior to the partnership, SHSC was only offering loans to local farmers. It decided to join FEP when it realized that smallholder producers struggled to settle their obligations because they did not have a stable market or a system to ensure steady earnings.\n\n “It was unsystematic before... They would bring their products to the market and only then would they know the price. There wasn't a strategy in terms of marketing, so their produce sometimes went to waste due to spoilage,” said Stephanie Labcaen, Business Development Center Head. “The coop then decided to join FEP so we could learn how to help farmers organize themselves and provide them marketing assistance—so they could be entrepreneurs supplying to institutional buyers.”\n\n SHSC took home the knowledge they gained in the program as its local implementing partner. It organized local farmers, including the Tagudin Agroentrepreneurs Association (TAA), and taught them the Agro-Enterprise Clustering Approach (AECA).\n\n This required persistence and patience. Some of the farmers resisted the idea of selling at a fixed price. Over the years, SHSC was able to grow the ranks of farmers to 193, working in clusters to supply white onions to Jollibee Group. Since 2014, TAA has delivered more than 650,000 kilos of white onions.\n\n In 2018, SHSC was also able to organize its farmer members to deliver other vegetables to Jollibee Group, making SHSC an accredited supplier aside from being a support organization to TAA. The vegetables they have supplied include bell pepper, hot pepper, and tomato.\n\n “The most important lesson is 'Don't give up.' Not everyone will be receptive to the idea,” said Stephanie. “I learned to be more understanding when dealing with farmers and other stakeholders. As an implementer, you should have the knowledge and patience to guide them through the purpose of the program.”",

    "title": "Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.: Helping Farmers Build a Sustainable Business",
    "preview": "Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI) strives to live up to its name by assisting farmer groups as a micro-finance institution.\n\n As an ever-reliable partner to the Foundation, ASHI was instrumental in assisting AGAP Farmers Association to become a spring onion supplier, delivering to the Chowking commissary.\n\n In 2022, AGAP became the first group in Luzon to undertake direct-to-restaurant deliveries of various vegetables to Chowking branches in Laguna.\n\n",
    "followup": "This involves a different process compared to the commissary delivery, as farmers are expected to have more regular transactions with the branches and fulfill their differing requirements.\n\n Furthermore, ASHI helped its farmer members gain a new market within the Jollibee Group—Mang Inasal. The farmers in Rizal grow ginger, which are then processed by the farmers in Laguna before delivery to the Mang Inasal commissary in Bulacan.\n\n Farmer leader Rolando Pega is a former jeepney conductor who ventured into farming in 2014. He received loans and various business training from ASHI. “Since I became part of FEP through the help of ASHI, we were able to have our own market where prices are stable and our earning is good,” he said in Filipino.\n\n As he reaps the fruits of his labor, Lando pays it forward by leading his fellow farmers. This earned him the Special Award for Agri Micro-Business at the 2019 Citi Microentrepreneurship Awards.\n\n ASHI's partnership with the Foundation continues to thrive because of the shared commitment to the growth and progress of Filipino farmers. As Angel Dorado, ASHI's Business Development Department Head, aptly puts it: “We should teach them that they are not just farmers, but they are farmer-entrepreneurs.”\n\n Angel said the partnership also benefits them as a micro-finance institution that aims to make farmers' livelihoods more sustainable, because they learn more from the culture of knowledge-sharing that the Foundation fosters. This is in terms of expertise and experiences on the Agro-Enterprise Clustering Approach, which has guided farmers in supplying to institutional markets.\n\n He said this is a crucial step in the journey to achieving their ultimate dream: “for the heroism of smallholder farmers to be recognized.”",

    "title": "Central Luzon State University: Building Up Agri-Tech",
    "preview": "Science is key to improving and modernizing agricultural practices. With this in mind, the Central Luzon State University (CLSU) is committed to sharing its expertise and resources for the benefit of farmers.\n\n Located in the Science City of Muñoz in Nueva Ecija, the university has extensive investment in agri-tech through its various research centers and colleges, which seek “to continually produce the necessary mechanism to promote relevant agricultural education in the country.”\n\n",
    "followup": "As a partner under the Farmer Entrepreneurship Program (FEP), CLSU has contributed greatly to various agri-tech projects that capacitate smallholder producers. In sharing the Foundation's advocacy, the partnership also provides opportunities for its faculty and students to gain knowledge on agro-entrepreneurship.\n\n “We partnered with Jollibee Group Foundation (JGF) because we believe in and share JGF's advocacy thrust on empowering smallholder producers so that they could benefit further from their agri-business activities. Through the partnership, CLSU was able to share its available agricultural innovations and expertise to assist more farmers in improving their farming system, yield, and income. But at the same time, the engagement enabled CLSU faculty and students to hone their agro-entrepreneurship know-how. This is mainly through attendance to JGF-organized courses or exposure to the developing agri-business activities of FEP-assisted farmer cooperatives,” said Dr. Edgar Orden, CLSU President.\n\n In 2021, JGF and CLSU, together with Jollibee Group's Business Technology Group and IBM's Weather Company, launched the Weather Information Notification System project. A game changer for FEP farmers, the project provided hyper-local weather data to help farmers plan their field activities. The university plays a crucial role in the process, as it handles the analysis and translation of weather data into daily reports that farmers receive through their respective Facebook groups.\n\n The reports generated by CLSU every day include practical farming recommendations, such as the timing of planting, irrigation, and application of fertilizers, among others.\n\n In 2022, CLSU also took part in the Foundation's collaborative Soil Health Regeneration Project, taking charge of documentation to determine project results and effectiveness, and to disseminate the knowledge gained to more farmers. The project introduced to onion FEP farmers the use of effective microorganisms and aided the shift from synthetic to organic fertilizers to boost soil health in the long term.\n\n The university has also been tapped by JGF as the overall project lead for an Onion Varietal Trial Project implemented in three sites namely, Nueva Ecija, Leyte, and Benguet. This initiative aims to assess how different agro-ecosystems affect the growth of different onion varieties. The results will inform farmers of the variety and production practices that are best suited in their area. This project is also in partnership with Visayas State University and the Bureau of Plant Industry - Baguio National Crop Research, Development and Production Support Center.\n\n “We value CLSU's partnership with JGF because it provides an important platform for the university to translate its research outputs into meaningful outcomes, reach more stakeholders, and influence agricultural and socio-economic development in the process,” said Dr. Edgar.",
