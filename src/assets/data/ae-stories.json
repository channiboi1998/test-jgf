    "preview": "The COVID-19 pandemic changed the world overnight, forcing humanity to chart its path toward a “new normal.” For the Foundation and Xavier University - Ateneo de Cagayan (XU), the challenges became an opportunity to innovate for a shared cause.\n\n Out of this partnership emerged the Agro-Entrepreneurship for Inclusive Value Chains (AEIVC) course, an online learning opportunity that aims to develop   more agri-facilitators who can help organize and guide farmers through the Agro-Enterprise Clustering Approach, as applied in the Farmer  Entrepreneurship Program.\n\n The AEIVC Introductory Course has 205 graduates since its launch in 2021. These include participants from farmer cooperatives, local government units, government agencies, micro finance institutions, academe, corporate foundations, and social enterprises coming from all over the country.\n\n",
    "followup": "2022 then saw the onset of the Intermediate course, which was offered to select agro-enterprise acilitators who completed the Introductory Course and demonstrated a successful implementation of their agro-enterprise plans.\n\n Faculty members from the XU College of Agriculture worked with the Foundation to develop the course and served as instructors as well. Moreover, the university provided an online learning management system to support asynchronous learning.\n\n XU College of Agriculture Dean Maria Rosario Mosqueda said this collaboration is “aligned” with their “mission of forming 'leaders and innovators'” for sustainable agriculture.\n\n For her part, assistant professor Jerelyn Medalla said the collaboration “deepened [her] appreciation and understanding” of the Agro-Entrepreneurship Clustering Approach. It was also an opportunity for her and her colleagues to get creative in learning delivery by combining different strategies such as the use of video clips and pre-work activities, and integrating games and breakout activities to make the presentations more dynamic and interactive.\n\n “I also learned from the experiences of the participants and from the team,” she added. “It's so satisfying to have shared something with them, specifically related to the agricultural sector's development.”\n\n XU President Fr. Mars Tan, SJ, takes pride in the partnership and looks forward to the program bearing fruit. “There is a much greater call ahead. An essential work that we have to take on,” he said, adding that agri-facilitators who completed the course should “share with [the farmers] the hope and confidence they need.”\n\n “It is my fervent hope that what you've learned from one another, from your activities, and from your mentors/trainers will enable you to contribute more in advancing the cause of smallholder farmers and of the whole agriculture entrepreneurship program in the country,” said Fr. Mars during the AEIVC gradua- tion ceremony.",

    "title": "Department of Agriculture: Bringing a Shared Mission to Life through Government - Private Sector Collaboration",
    "preview": "The Foundation's partnership with the Department of Agriculture (DA) is another manifestation of its commitment to contribute to nation-building. The tie-up with DA's Farm and Fisheries Clustering and Consolidation (F2C2) Program aims to train more agri-facilitators so they can be better equipped in helping farmers embrace clustering and consolidation as a business enterprise.\n\n",
    "followup": "“This is a good opportunity for them not only to focus on production, which is their old practice, but also to engage them in business,” said DA Senior Undersecretary Domingo Panganiban. “The training is a good avenue for our farmers for future partnership with the private sector, other big companies, and institutional markets where they can sell their produce.”\n\n In keeping with the goal to train at least two agri-facilitators for each of the department's 15 regional field offices, DA personnel underwent the Foundation's Agro-entrepreneurship for Inclusive Value Chains course, which JGF and Xavier University - Ateneo de Cagayan offer as capacity building and coaching support. Here, they learn about the Agro-Enterprise Clustering Approach, which is used in JGF's Farmer Entrepreneurship Program to guide farmers in supplying to corporate markets.\n\n The training is expected to bolster the participants' capabilities in guiding smallholder farmers toward the collective goal of an “empowered and prosperous” agriculture sector. This is consistent with the directives of the President Secretary to achieve food sufficiency in the country.\n\n “The good thing about Agro-Enterprise Clustering Approach is it's not just about how farmers can harvest well, it is really focused on how to help them sell and earn,” said Agriculturist Melvince Martirez of DA-Regional Field Office (RFO) VIII.\n\n For his part, DA-RFO II Senior Agriculturist Jay Lord Bagasin said the course opened his eyes to the multipronged challenge that farmers go through every day, and how such problems can be addressed.\n\n “I learned a lot during the course because the theories and concepts learned are backed up by the sharing of experiences of successful farm clusters and active interaction with co-participants during breakout sessions,” he said.\n\n “Convergence among the stakeholders is needed to address the technical and adaptive challenges affecting farmers. Truly, no institution is an island. DA cannot do it alone. It needs the help of other agencies and private institutions in fulfilling its mandate to help our farmers attain <i>'masaganang ani at mataas na kita'</i> (bountiful harvest and high earnings),” he added.",

    "title": "Promoting Knowledge Sharing for Agro-Entrepreneurship",
    "preview": "The Foundation's advocacy of promoting agro-entrepreneurship and inclusive business reaches more sectors—local and international—with the help of its industry and government partners who extend their platforms for knowledge sharing.\n\n In 2022, the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) recognized JGF's efforts to contribute to the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In <a href='https://sdg.neda.gov.ph/2022-vnr-report/' class='text-blue' target='_blank'>NEDA's 2022 Voluntary National Review of the Philippines</a>, the Foundation's Farmer Entrepreneurship Program (FEP) and FoodAID initiatives were tagged “best practices contributing to SDG 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger.”\n\n",
    "followup": "The Foundation also shared its experiences in NEDA's SDG Summit, serving as the private sector panelist for the session “Pace of Progress on the SDG Implementation in the Philippines,” alongside representatives from NEDA, the Philippine Statistics Office, the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the International Labor Organization.\n\n The Foundation likewise collaborated with the Philippines Partnership for Sustainable Agriculture for the Agro-Enterprise Clustering Approach (AECA) learning session in March 2022. The said online event gathered some 150 participants from various sectors. In the session, JGF and FEP partners shared how AECA has helped smallholder farmers improve their livelihood and income as they become suppliers of corporate markets.\n\n As the session was attended by organizations that support farmers, it also brought to light the importance of including farmer leaders in decision-making, and the need to cultivate their business mindset.\n\n Grow Asia—an international multi-stakeholder platform for more inclusive, resilient, and sustainable food systems—developed a <a href='http://exchange.growasia.org/jollibee-foods-corporation-case-study-responsible-investment-farmer-entrepreneurship-philippines' class='text-blue' target='_blank'>case study on FEP</a> as part of a series on how such initiative aligns with the ASEAN Guidelines on Responsible Investment in Food, Agriculture, and Forestry.\n\n “We have seen the phenomenal potential that gets realized when different players in the agriculture sector come together, and how this can result in significant change in the lives of the growers and agri-micro, small and medium enterprises,” said Grow Asia Executive Director Beverley Postma in her message to the agri facilitator graduates of the course “Agro-entrepreneurship for Inclusive Value Chains.”\n\n She added that for lasting change to occur, it is important to “welcome the support of other organizations that are willing to share challenges and triumphs with us.”\n\n Lastly, the Foundation's work for agriculture and food security were also featured in the <a href='https://www.inclusivebusiness.net/node/5945' target='_blank' class='text-blue'>“Ten Years of Inclusive Business in the Philippines”</a> report, released by the Inclusive Business Action Network. It cited FEP as “a commercially viable partnership” between the Foundation and farmers, and highlighted as well the different innovations that improved the program.",
