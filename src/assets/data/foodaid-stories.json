    "title": "Roxas City LGU: Extending the BLT Kitchen to Communities",
    "preview": "Jollibee Group Foundation (JGF) has long been invested in ensuring access to food, particularly among school children under its Busog, Lusog, Talino (BLT) School Feeding Program. Through BLT, JGF and its partners provided daily meals to undernourished children to help them stay in school. But over the pandemic, its model has also been beneficial to communities—as shown in the case of Roxas City in Capiz.\n\n Prior to the onset of the pandemic, the City Government, led by Mayor Ronnie Dadivas, forged a partnership with the Foundation which led to the establishment of the BLT Central Kitchen at Inzo Arnaldo Village, about five minutes away from the City Hall.\n\n",
    "followup": "Launched in 2021, this was the first BLT kitchen in Panay Island. The partnership is aligned with Mayor Ronnie's executive agenda for food security.\n\n However, due to school closure and the drastic change in needs caused by COVID-19, the Kitchen has shifted its service from schools to communities, especially during crises.\n\n During the lockdowns and at the surge of typhoons Odette, Paeng, and Agaton, the BLT Kitchen catered to frontliners, stranded passengers, and evacuees.\n\n “This BLT Central Kitchen has a huge impact on us. Perhaps it was a blessing in disguise that it was established in the midst of the pandemic, because it helped us a lot during the lockdown and the calamities that occurred in the same period,” said Perseus Cordova, Roxas City's social welfare development officer.\n\n For the evacuees from calamities, the BLT kitchen served congee because it could be easily prepared and distributed. JGF prepositions congee mix with its partners so it can be immediately used during calamities. “During typhoons, the Kitchen is operational 24/7 and accepts volunteers,” said Perseus. The congee is delivered to 16 of the city's evacuation centers with 3,000 to 4,000 families.\n\n The Kitchen employs seven full-time staff, which were trained by JGF on proper use of equipment, food preparation, and kitchen maintenance.\n\n Even without calamities, the BLT Kitchen in Roxas City continues to serve different areas. Currently, it delivers meals to 12 day care centers that cater to 900 children. It provides three meals per day to the city's crisis center, which houses children in conflict with the law and abused children. It also offers a week's worth of meals to families affected by fire incidents.\n\n “It is an eye-opener, that the BLT Central Kitchen can be used in different modalities—not just in school, but also in a community-based feeding program,” said Perseus. “It's a good initiative to build trust in the community and a sense of volunteerism among parents.”\n\n To maximize the Kitchen, the city government will also use it for livelihood. Perseus hopes to add more BLT Kitchens to serve other parts of the city. With their effective approach in community feeding, the barangay council of Lanot in Roxas City adopted the program, building their own “Busog Lusog Kitchen” to be used in disasters.\n\n “I saw the beauty of this partnership because JGF targets community partnership—building the trust of the community and local government unit, so they can work together as one,” Perseus said.",

    "title": "Center for Community Transformation: Sharing Joy Through Food",
    "preview": "Ensuring food security among communities is an endeavor that is best achieved through collaboration, as proven by the Foundation's continuing work.\n\n In September 2022, the Foundation began its partnership with the Center for Community Transformation (CCT), a non-government organization that helps poverty sectors nationwide through holistic interventions. Among its programs is providing microfinance services, issuing capital and loans to indigent people who would otherwise be unable to fulfill bank requirements.\n\n",
    "followup": "The collaboration began when CCT sought more partners for food distribution to support its various outreach initiatives. One of the potential partners they approached was Jollibee Group Foundation (JGF). “When we think of Jollibee, we think of happiness,” said Arlene Sy, Executive Director for Partnership-Communications. “We would be honored to partner with JGF in bringing food to the poor.”\n\n Under the partnership, food items provided by JGF are distributed to families in select communities. One of these is Chicken Guisado, a ready-to-cook food pack developed by Jollibee Group's Research and Development Team in 2020 to allow more people to be provided with a nutritious meal at a lower cost.\n\n “We select the communities from our database, those that are really in need. We teach the families how to cook [the chicken guisado] so they can have food on their table,” said Arlene. “It's not just distribution, but also outreach.”\n\n Joining the staff in distributing the food are some 100 volunteers, most of whom are mothers engaged by CCT in its microfinance program. At least 6,000 people have benefited from the partnership, most of them in the Greater Manila Area. Street dwellers, including children, were also fed through the initiative.\n\n “The recipients are very happy, especially when they hear that the food is from Jollibee or Chowking. They also said the Chicken Guisado is delicious and use it in their vegetable dishes. Of course, the volunteers and staff are delighted to be part of this program too. It's an answered prayer whenever someone responds to the needs of the community,” she said.\n\n She also underscored that the experience has highlighted how helping communities in need is best done collaboratively.\n\n “There is a lot of demand, and we know for a fact that one organization cannot just do it. We need partnerships with others, especially those who have resources, to keep doing what we're doing,” said Arlene. “I've always believed in the power of collaboration and that is one of our learnings from JGF—a collaboration with common values. The partnership also adds value to CCT because of Jollibee Group's reputation, credibility, and image.”",

    "title": "Jollibee Worldwide Services Logistics: Service Beyond Duty",
    "preview": "Working with Jollibee Group Foundation (JGF) has given many employees within the Jollibee Group an opportunity to serve others through their work.\n\n Jollibee Worldwide Services Logistics (JWSL), which facilitates the supply management of Jollibee Group products nationwide and in select international markets, contributes to the Foundation's work through logistics.\n\n",
    "followup": "Through JWSL, food donations are allotted and transported to partners. The coordination and system between JWSL and JGF need to be efficient to ensure that food items—mostly ready-to-cook food—will be timely and correctly delivered to the partners, and that spoilage will be avoided.\n\n The partnership with JWSL falls under the wide network of Jollibee Group units that make initiatives like FoodAID possible.\n\n Donating ready-to-cook food items started at the height of the pandemic in 2020, as many communities were in need of food due to the lockdowns. JWSL's Supply Chain Management team facilitated many donation requests from Jollibee Group brands.\n\n Among the team is Senior Account Manager Cosette Bo. She was also part of the team that responded to FoodAID for Typhoon Quinta, which greatly affected South Luzon. She recalled having to immediately source sacks of rice to be delivered to the area. These were used to prepare hot meals like congee.\n\n “Sometimes, this work is on top of our daily activities. There are days when we are occupied with meetings throughout the day, then we receive instructions on items to be donated. We would start the coordination at the end of day but we don't mind because it's actually fulfilling,” Cosette said.\n\n “When JGF sends pictures of happy beneficiaries, it's always a good feeling to know you've been part of the activities that lead to the food reaching communities who will benefit from them,” she added.",
