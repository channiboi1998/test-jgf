    "preview": "The agriculture industry in the Philippines is in a race against time as farmers get older at work. This is why it is important to cultivate among the youth a change in perspective, for them to see that farming can be a productive career option for them, too.\n\n This is an advocacy shared by Jollibee Group Foundation (JGF) and Don Bosco Training Center - Mati. Their partnership, which started in 2018, was facilitated by Don Bosco - One TVET Philippines. Prior to this, JGF worked with other schools under the Don Bosco network for its ACE Scholarship Program.\n\n",
    "followup": "Don Bosco Mati has always been inclined to teach agriculture; in fact, it was always one of the subjects in their courses. They saw the effort of the students from producing to selling crops, and realized that the subject was not enough—the students needed to gain more qualifications so they could focus on agriculture.\n\n JGF and Don Bosco Mati then co-developed one of the first agro-entrepreneurship courses in the country, accredited by the Technical and Educational Skills Development Authority (TESDA). JGF also offers scholarships for this course.\n\n According to training director Fr. Leo Polutan, SDB, this was not an easy process to complete as some of their faculty did not have a background in agriculture. However, with their passion and dedication, they have achieved their goal.\n\n Don Bosco Training Center Mati now offers Integrated Farming Technology, with specialization in Organic Agriculture Production National Certificate (NC) II and Agro-Entrepreneurship NC II, as part of its technical-vocational education and training courses.\n\n Since its launch in 2021, 131 students comprising four batches have availed of the program. Aside from their main lessons on agro-entrepreneurship, the students likewise undergo basic leadership training.\n\n “Based on our experience in the community, more teenage local farmers are availing of our agriculture courses,” he said. “This means we have students who wish to go back to the farm after their studies. They see that their knowledge of agro-entrepreneurship will reap benefits because their livelihood will be sustainable.”\n\n They had two scholars who, after taking the course, pursued college. One took up agriculture. Still, both of them go back to help their communities make farming more productive and sustainable.\n\n “We also had a student who now works at DTI (Department of Trade and Industry). What he learned from agro-entrepreneurship helps him in assisting and monitoring small businesses in Davao Oriental, which support local farmers,” Fr. Leo said.\n\n Now, Don Bosco Mati endeavors for all their faculty to be certified agro-entrepreneurship instructors by having them take the course, too. They have also sent one of their trainers to Don Bosco Victorias in Negros Occidental, as the latter is in the process of developing its own agriculture program.\n\n “We have to continue this program because we see there is fulfillment. It becomes an eye-opener for students as they realize there is money in farming. The parents become motivated too as they see the farm improvements being initiated by their children,” said Fr. Leo. “We are blessed that we, JGF and Don Bosco, are instruments in addressing the challenges in agriculture.”",

    "preview": "Beyond the crucial work of changing the mindsets of Filipino farmers now, an equally daunting yet fulfilling task lies in encouraging the next generation to embrace agriculture as a viable source of livelihood.\n\n As it helps farmer groups adapt and fulfill their obligations under the Farmer Entrepreneurship Program (FEP), the Sacred Heart Savings Cooperative (SHSC) is also preparing budding farmers to carry agro-entrepreneurship toward the future. In 2019, it began encouraging individuals aged 18 to 30 to get into farming through various agriculture-related initiatives. This includes the children of farmers enrolled in FEP, who join their family members in the program.\n\n",
    "followup": "The cooperative, which has its own training and assessment center, partnered with the Foundation for the establishment of an Agro-Enterprise Resource Center (AERC), which offers an agro-entrepreneurship course accredited by the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA).\n\n The establishment of the community-based AERC in late 2021 allows training “designed to specific needs and interests of the learner,” said SHSC training officer Joseph Roam. “Often there is hands-on and practical [application], and the trainee's progress is at his own pace,” he added.\n\n SHSC looks at this partnership as an important step to ensure the sustainability of agro-entrepreneurship in its community.\n\n “It is important for us at the Sacred Heart Savings Cooperative because we help young farmers in building their capacity to become agro-entrepreneurs and leaders in promoting agriculture and entrepreneurship. That is the main objective of the AERC,” said Joseph.\n\n For her part, Business Development Head Stephanie Labcaen said it is important “to encourage the youth to embrace agriculture” and to help them see it as a business.\n\n “It's important to inculcate in our youth the importance of agro-entrepreneurship, of turning farming into a business. This is so we can invite more youth to continue what their parents have started, so that they could look at farming as a worthy endeavor,” said Stephanie.",
